# About this repoüîç
This is a backend client for the EZ Vote app. It was made using: 

* Typescript [![typescript][typescript]][typescript-url]
* Express [![express][express]][express-url]
* MySQL [![mysql][mysql]][mysql-url]
* MariaDB [![mariadb][mariadb]][mariadb-url]
* Additional packages, such as [cookie-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser), [Express Rate Limit](https://github.com/express-rate-limit/express-rate-limit)

### Install locally
To install EZ Vote locally:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mp-martin/ez-vote-back.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Generate public / private key pair for authorization to work. To do this, run `generateKeypair.ts` file. 
Two files should now appear in the main directory: `id_rsa_pub.pem` and `id_rsa_priv.pem`
4. Configure `config.example.ts` by removing comments, setting the variables according to your environment and renaming the file to `config.ts`
5. Run npm start
```sh
npm start
```

###
<span style="color:#FF5F9E">You will need the EZ Vote front-end client installed to run the app</span>. 

You also have to set up an SQL database (use my [template MariaDB sql file](https://zar.networkmanager.pl/static/readme/ezvote_db_tables.sql) for creating proper tables)

Check out the front-end app at [https://github.com/mp-martin/ez-vote-front](https://github.com/mp-martin/ez-vote-front)

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the file structure of both apps is this *(and mind the folder names)*:

```
‚îú‚îÄ //your folder
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ez-vote-backend
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ez-vote-frontend
```
